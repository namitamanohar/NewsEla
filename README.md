# Quiz Question Data Analysis 

In my analysis low scoring questions were defined as less than 50% and high scoring questions were defined as higher than 50%. 

There was an array of common words that were used to sanitize the results. Some common words related to reading comprehension questions that were removed from the results were article, sentence, which, following, select, paragraph, and best. The words selected can be modified based on the analyzer's discretion. 

From my analysis, the words most commonly found in the low scoring responses were read, not, all, why, except, does, section, idea, show, word, and how. 

The words most commonly found in the high scoring responses were read, why, word, not, how, does, all, according, except, and above .
